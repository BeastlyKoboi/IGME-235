        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The witcher Geralt of Rivia once lived in the secluded mountain fortress Kaer Morhen, where he enjoyed a
            peaceful life with his beloved Yennefer and, together with his fellow witchers, trained a young girl named
            Ciri,
            the daughter of Emhyr var Emreis, Emperor of Nilfgaard. Following a prolonged memory loss and other
            turbulent
            events described in his previous adventures, Geralt eventually gets close to a reunion with Yennefer, whom
            he
            hasn't seen in a long time. Meanwhile, the Empire of Nilfgaard invades the Northern Kingdoms, and Geralt is
            contacted by the Emperor who asks him to find Ciri. In the midst of these events, a supernatural army known
            as
            the Wild Hunt appears in the region, threatening to obliterate everything in their path towards an unknown
            goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game, the third main installment in the Witcher series, and a sequel to
            Assassins of Kings. Most gameplay elements from the previous games have been carried over, including the
            usage
            of two sword types for different classes of enemies, usage of magic, a skill-based character growth, and an
            extensive alchemy system allowing Geralt to ingest mutagens for various benefits. Combat system has been
            slightly modified to allow smoother fighting against multiple opponents and usage of long-ranged weapons.
            Weapon
            and armor customization options have been noticeably increased. Like before, certain sections of the story
            are
            dictated by the player's moral choices, which are also present in the game's more prominent side quests.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main difference between this entry and the preceding installments are physical interactivity and the
            inclusion of open-world elements. Geralt can now jump, swim, dive, ride a horse, and travel by boat, making
            nearly every location in the game world accessible for exploration. While Geralt can not travel anywhere
            right
            away, each area he visits is significantly larger than before and contains many more optional locations.
            Geralt
            can use his witcher senses to track people and investigate mysterious occurrences. There is a night and day
            cycle, dynamic weather effects, as well as the possibility to craft one's own weapons and armor. During a
            few
            segments, Ciri becomes the playable character instead of Geralt.

        <blockquote>
            <i>
                The beauty of this game is that pretty much every major aspect of it is satisfying, and they all work
                together marvelously as a harmonious whole. It's a strong plot- and character-driven game full of
                cinematic
                moments and dialogues with ethical choices, and yet it doesn't shrink the playing area like many modern
                RPGs
                of the same mold. It's a magnanimous open-ended game with many locations to visit, yet it doesn't lower
                its
                standards of writing and narrative to accommodate that.

                Saying that Witcher 3 is the best in the series wouldn't be enough to do it justice. The Polish
                developers
                have created one of the best role-playing games in recent memory, an exquisite product that gracefully
                combines the spirit of hardcore classic playing with modern sensibilities. Play it, savor it, love it.
