    <h1>Follow The Sound</h1>

    <p>
        Curiousity getting the best of you, you divert your course towards the noise you hear. It steadily gets 
        louder and louder as you make your way forward. The light of your lantern finally reveals a covered section 
        of the tunnel, inside of which lies a staircase. A staircase which supposedly led nowhere, yet had the
        unmistakeable sounds of footsteps and the screeching of a train. You could sense the air was less stale 
        here than before and that both chilled and excited you.
