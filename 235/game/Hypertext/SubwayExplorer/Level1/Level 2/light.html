    <h1>Go To The Light</h1>

    <p>
        Determined to find that mural and view it in all its glory you ignore the sound and head forward. As you 
        head towards the light, you find the blurry outline of people. Two people crowding around a wall with 
        buckets. You get within speaking distance and see they also have large painter's brushes. You also see 
        that they are young, practically teenagers. You see around them, drawn haphazardly are phalluses, still 
        wet from creation. A quick "Hey" from you was all it took to send them running, though you don't know why. 
        Proof of their youth, that they believed this was the height of criminality. Though certainly a crime in 
        your eyes. Fortunately the mural you came to photograph was spared. You stop to admire it, before finally 
        taking a photo. You head back, no noise to divert you this time and go back to your car, sun now shining 
        and turn the key which started the car with no objections.
