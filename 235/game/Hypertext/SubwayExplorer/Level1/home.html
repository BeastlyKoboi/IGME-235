    <h1>Home Bound</h1>

    <p>
        You heave a big sigh while looking at the entrance, and turn away. You decide to wait for a day where you 
        won't be likely to trip once inside. Quickly, you make a dash back to your car. Once there you dry off 
        inside and try to start the car. A car which refuses to start. A problem you have been having recently, 
        which slips your mind every time it works as intended. You decide to call your friend to pick you up, but 
        it looks like it'll be a while until they arrive. After the call you consider entering the subway as you 
        originally intended or just waiting in the car, so you don't get soaked even more.
