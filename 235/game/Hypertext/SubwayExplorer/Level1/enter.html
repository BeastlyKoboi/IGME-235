    <h1>Enter The Subway</h1>

    <p>
        You enter the subway splattered in rain. You quickly adjust to the light levels and make your way further
        towards where the mural was. You begin to hear slight squishing, light pitter patter, and a strange SCREECH, from a different 
        direction from where you entered. This seemed strange to you, as you remember that the entrance that way 
        was covered along time ago. At the same time you can finally make out a feeble ray of light near where 
        you were headed. Curiousity naws at the back of your mind.
