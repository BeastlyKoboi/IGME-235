    <h1>Subway Explorer</h1>

    <p>
        The sky is a howling torrent and the sun is nowhere to be seen. You walk along the gravel with a oversized 
        poncho covering you and a bright lantern guiding you, towards the opening of the subway ahead. Despite the 
        poor conditions your steps are resolute and eyes determined, because you had something to see. A lovely 
        mural that you had the pleasure of viewing only once before was stuck in your head, and nowhere else since 
        your photo got corrupted somehow. Today was the only free day you have for a while and you decided it was 
        time to revisit the mural for another photo. You pause and glance at the sky. A moment of indecision 
        strikes and you contemplate just going home now.
