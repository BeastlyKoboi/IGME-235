    <h1>A Fine Match!</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>
        A fast paced mix between a memory match game and a turn-based battler. Try to match cards
        turn by turn against your opponent in order to attack and accumulate block, all while under
        a short time limit. You even have the option of switching two cards to confuse your opponent.
        Just make sure you remember everything!
    </p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Card</li>
        <li>Puzzle</li>
        <li>Strategy</li>
        <li>RPG</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>
        Desktop web would probably be best since on small screens, flipping over specific cards in a
        large grid might be tougher to do.
    </p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        You play a novice Cardcaster that is attempting to make their way through a dangerous hilly area,
        where they will fight their first battles in their journey to become the greatest mage ever and
        more currently, get out alive. You progress through the hills into a valley fighting stronger and
        quicker enemies as you go.
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        I would probably aim for pixel art medium, with a slight fantasy style (swords, shields, and monsters).
        It probably won't be too visually detailed though. I will likely have a basic player, enemy, and hilly
        background, and the cards themselves will be just a couple different symbols in the center with different
        colors if needed. The cards could also look a bit disheveled and hand drawn. The sounds will likely be just
        a hit noise, an error noise, and some intense but repetitive background music.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        In this game you have the option to choose 2 cards in the grid to flip over and try to match
        them. If you flip over two cards and they match, you are allowed to do the action on the card, which is
        add block, charge attack more, or actually attack. The enemy attacks at regular short intervals (5-15s),
        but at the beginning of the fight you have a 100% chance of dodging, a percentage which slowly decreases
        as the game goes on (the cardcaster get more exhausted). After every unsuccessful enemy attack, the
        positions of two cards in the grid get swapped (the Cardcaster dropped them while dodging and picked them
        back up). When swapping these cards, they do not turn over, but the position movements are still visible.
        The main struggle will be remembering as time goes on, while contending with the swapping places, in a
        short time frame. During the time between enemy attacks you can try to match as many cards as you can
        before it tries to hit you. Each choice of two cards will take about two seconds to reveal and either
        commit an action or make an error sound. You will have limited health, so you will only survive a few
        attacks. Also if you end up matching everything in the grid, it will just fill up again, while perhaps
        giving the player bonus time before the next attack, as if the final match in that grid disoriented it.
        <br>
        The tuturial would likely be one with a very generous time limit and an easy enemy. After that enemy is
        defeated, the next one will have a lesser time limit and a stronger or more sturdy enemy. It will go like
        that until the player is able to match the intensity. The first fight will have directions for what to do,
        and hints (which will go away) for what cards to pick and what the symbols mean. This will likely mean a
        strong degree of repeatability with enemies, only by changing time limits, health values, and attack values,
        making them easier to make more of them.

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
        Starting out in this project, I used the basic skeleton of the Circle Blast project. My first priority was
        making the card select and animation functionality. This was central to my plan and needed to be figured
        out early. I made early card designs that actually ended up being the only card designs, because I liked
        them. The solution to the flip animations was the first thought that came to me, which was scaling down the
        width over time, switching the texture, then scaling it up again. Frankly I was hoping that it would look
        good, because it was my only idea. It turned out fine, I think mainly due to the actual speed of the flip
        which makes the eyes fill in the details. To simplify things early, whenever a match occurred, I just scaled
        it down until 0, then deleted it. This animation ended up sticking around too. A Card class was definitely
        necessary for all of this, and I am glad I made it one.
        <br><br>
        I originally had the cards flip synchronously once two had been selected, which made it had for you to know
        or remember what card you have already selected. From feedback there were two solutions to this, either make
        it obvious when you have selected a card, or start their flip animations asynchronously. The first one
        sounded easier, but I liked the second idea better. This was a real challenge to make happen though, since
        the system for matching relied upon the animations being identical. So it was a task of redoing what worked
        in a different way. This took a longer amount of time than I would have liked. It also created some clicking
        errors, while exposing some existing ones. Two big ones were cards flipping over twice if you clicked too
        fast, and cards sometimes still having a cardback background while flipping. The second one, I realized, was
        due to not clearing the board and removing cards from the game scene on a loss. The first one was caused by
        a simple mistake of having a greater than and lesser than check for timePaused, while not checking at all
        for equals. Very easy to miss and glad I found it.
        <br><br>
        In this project I wanted to challenge myself to make all of my own assets (except fonts of course), which I
        am glad to say I did. For fonts I used Professor Chin's video to help me and google fonts.
        <br><br>
        The first win state for the game was put in as a placeholder, as just clearing the entire board once. When I
        finally put hearts up for both the player and enemy, I changed it to when the hearts deplete on either side.
        Once that occured I finally labeled the dodge chance and countdown, because it was said that the game was
        difficult to understand on that front. I ended up creating helper methods for creating buttons and labels in
        order to simplify this process. I would have done the same for the character sprites if their were more than
        two.
        <br><br>
        There were two last minute additions to this project that seemed necessary for a semi-completed project,
        which were some basic instructions on the start page, and the music/sounds during the gameplay. The
        instructions were made as a quick band-aid to the troubles of people not understanding how to play at the
        outset. So their strange placement and lack of clarity are a product of lack of time on my part. The sounds
        were additions that were needed once I realized it was part of the requirements. I found this online sound
        maker called BeepBox which served my needs and created a match and wrong sound, alongside a loopable
        bckground tune. A tune which I realized can get annoying. So, in the future I fully intend to create a button
        to turn the sounds off altogether. Also my use of Howler created a warning in the console that I have not
        discovered the reason for, since I do not think I am attempting to play music when the page loads.
        <br><br>
        I believe that this project accomplishes the requirements, due to a greater emphasis on graphic design than
        previous projects, a functional and as yet error free gameplay experience, with enough information given to
        set most people in the right direction to play. Also, the player has a way to meet harder challenges through
        the game via the increasing amount of enemy hearts after a win (capped at 6 hearts). The HTML and CSS are all
        validated and the javascript has mostly proper conduct in structure.
