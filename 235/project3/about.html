    <h1>A Fine Match!</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>
        A fast paced mix between a memory match game and a turn-based battler. Try to match cards 
        turn by turn against your opponent in order to attack and accumulate block, all while under
        a short time limit. You even have the option of switching two cards to confuse your opponent. 
        Just make sure you remember everything!
    </p>

    <h2>Genres</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Card</li>
        <li>Puzzle</li>
        <li>Strategy</li>
        <li>RPG</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>
        Desktop web would probably be best since on small screens, flipping over specific cards in a 
        large grid might be tougher to do.
    </p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        You play a novice Cardcaster that is attempting to make their way through a dangerous hilly area, 
        where they will fight their first battles in their journey to become the greatest mage ever and 
        more currently, get out alive. You progress through the hills into a valley fighting stronger and
        quicker enemies as you go. 
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        I would probably aim for pixel art medium, with a slight fantasy style (swords, shields, and monsters).
        It probably won't be too visually detailed though. I will likely have a basic player, enemy, and hilly 
        background, and the cards themselves will be just a couple different symbols in the center with different 
        colors if needed. The cards could also look a bit disheveled and hand drawn. The sounds will likely be just 
        a hit noise, an error noise, and some intense but repetitive background music. 
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        In this game you have the option to choose 2 cards in the grid to flip over and try to match 
        them. If you flip over two cards and they match, you are allowed to do the action on the card, which is 
        add block, charge attack more, or actually attack. The enemy attacks at regular short intervals (5-15s), 
        but at the beginning of the fight you have a 100% chance of dodging, a percentage which slowly decreases
        as the game goes on (the cardcaster get more exhausted). After every unsuccessful enemy attack, the 
        positions of two cards in the grid get swapped (the Cardcaster dropped them while dodging and picked them 
        back up). When swapping these cards, they do not turn over, but the position movements are still visible.  
        The main struggle will be remembering as time goes on, while contending with the swapping places, in a 
        short time frame. During the time between enemy attacks you can try to match as many cards as you can 
        before it tries to hit you. Each choice of two cards will take about two seconds to reveal and either 
        commit an action or make an error sound. You will have limited health, so you will only survive a few 
        attacks. Also if you end up matching everything in the grid, it will just fill up again, while perhaps 
        giving the player bonus time before the next attack, as if the final match in that grid disoriented it. 
        <br>
        The tuturial would likely be one with a very generous time limit and an easy enemy. After that enemy is 
        defeated, the next one will have a lesser time limit and a stronger or more sturdy enemy. It will go like 
        that until the player is able to match the intensity. The first fight will have directions for what to do, 
        and hints (which will go away) for what cards to pick and what the symbols mean. This will likely mean a 
        strong degree of repeatability with enemies, only by changing time limits, health values, and attack values, 
        making them easier to make more of them.
