                        Lovely to meet you! My name is Allan Flores and I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development
                        major at
                        RIT, with a planned minor in Web Development. I am endlessly fascinated with the storytelling
                        abilities of games and the underlying systems that make them a reality. I hope to contribute
                        meaningfully to the space, as well as doing it within a team of talented individuals. I have
                        experience with C#, Java, Unity, Visual Studio, and will be studying more C++ soon. I am very
                        technically minded and meticulous, but I intend to persist outside my comfort zone into refining
                        my
                        sense of design and creativity. With every project I take on, I learn greatly from the struggles
                        involved and the incredible people that surround me. It is my lifelong goal to find a way to
                        give
                        people a sense of fulfillment and ease in their life through my creations, a goal that I am well
                        on
                        my way to achieving.

                        A drilling game based off of Drillionaire, made in Unity as a personal project. You play 
                        a 9-5 worker who must drill to find ore to meet resource quotas and to sell for upgrades. 
                        All assets are custom made. There is a proof of concept WebGL build available and a viable 
                        version is in the works.

                        come like movie and book quotes.

                        spells, which have all sorts of effects. Effects like extending the time before the 
                        next attack, attacking, healing hearts, and adding dodge chance. All assets were custom
                        made specifically for this game.

                        A side-scrolling 2D platformer I worked on as a member of a team of four in Monogame. My
                        primary areas of responsibility were the level rendering, file management, and later the
                        animations. You would slash, blast, and jump your way through each level, until facing the
                        unique bosses. As you traverse each level, you can improve an ability to make the future
                        easier.

                    <p>
                        A topview exploration game in which the player must find and restore the fountain of objects,
                        then
                        return safely to the beginning. An early personal challenge that drew much inspiration from a
                        practice
                        exercise in the C# Players's Guide by RB Whitaker. In the textbook, it was a text-based game
                        based
                        on
                        one the first computer games called "Hunt the Wumpus." I decided to make a graphic version to
                        make
                        it
                        more fun for me, and to test myself.

                    <p>
                        This was a personal project I decided to try out over the summer, to keep my knowledge of
                        Monogame
                        fresh. It was a clear imitation of the popular game, but made with custom assets. I specifically
                        chose this project because I wanted to attempt to make something complete without assistance.
                        The
                        need for recursion when uncovering blocks of tiles was an obstacle I was proud to get past
                        alone.
