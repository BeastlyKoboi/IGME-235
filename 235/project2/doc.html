    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This project will use the Cheapshark API to create a website to find games that are at a discounted price. It is
        essentially a price comparison website. It is intended to be a helpful tool for game shopping.
    </p>

    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The audience will most likely be frugal gamers or gamers with a limited budget. Also anyone attempting to
        collect older games. This is a pretty widespread group as gamers these days are less likely to buy games on
        release at full price, due to a variety of reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Functionality</h2>
    <p>
        This website will be able to search discounts by name, rating, store, release date, and more. It should be able
        to sort between ranges of certain aspects (like rating and price) as well as provide a recommendation on the
        deal itself.
