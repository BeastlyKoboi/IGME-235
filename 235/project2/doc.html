    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This project will use the Cheapshark API to create a website to find games that are at a discounted price. It is
        essentially a price comparison website. It is intended to be a helpful tool for game shopping.
        The audience will most likely be frugal gamers or gamers with a limited budget. Also anyone attempting to
        collect older games. This is a pretty widespread group as gamers these days are less likely to buy games on
        release at full price, due to a variety of reasons.
        This website will be able to search discounts by name, rating, store, release date, and more. It should be able
        to sort between ranges of certain aspects (like rating and price) as well as provide a recommendation on the
        deal itself.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        I started out this project by making an attempt to prove I could actually get data from the 
        Cheapshark API, which proved initially difficult since I was using the Fetch .then() method 
        wrong. I figured out what happened after a while and was able to actually receive data, so I 
        went on to do the HTML legwork of creating essential divs and adding basic inputs. The API 
        docs were a very important guide to creating the URLs with the basic inputs. Adding the search
        by stores functionality was probably the hardest part of this bit. I started out with the 
        first twenty or so stores listed on the API as checkboxes, which would add the checked stores 
        to the URL. I managed to have basic information inserted in the results div, after successfully
        managing to parse that info. It was only later that I realized that many of the stores I listed 
        were not active anymore, so they would not be valid options, yet would not throw an error. So I 
        had to take a second look at all the stores and only have the active ones in the HTML and js.  
        I then relized that the actual store names were not listed with the games returned, just the 
        store IDs, which meant I either had to make another request to the API for it, or just have it
        mapped out beforehand. I chose the latter because it seemed simpler. It was a similar situation
        with the logos for each store's checkbox. The images themselves were on the API, but I could
        not access them due to a CORS error that I could not get around. So, I found it simpler to just
        download the images from the API and hard code it into the HTML. The CSS and many of the later 
        non-essential stretch inputs were added concurrently. It was pretty often that a design need 
        required some javascript and it in turn needed a new form of input. During this long period of 
        adjustments, I decided that I was using the exact same query selectors a lot in my javascript 
        that it might be better to just initialize them when the window loads and use them when needed. 
        That may not be good practice, but it made sense at the time. I also realized later than I 
        would have liked that I still did not do anything related to saving and getting from the 
        localStorage. That definitely provided its own series of problems. One main one was accidentally 
        saving null values to localStorage, then receiving them back causing errors. I ended up doing 
        some null checking and deleting the saved data off my browser. I implemented an indeterminate
        progress bar with inspiration from an example listed below. A considerable design barrier was 
        the low resolution of the images from many stores, and the non-conforming aspect ratio to those
        images. This forced my game results to be smaller than I wanted them to appear and gave many 
        a great deal of white space. I decided after speaking with the professor to focus on making the 
        discriptions level with each other was more important, so that it was more easily legible for 
        the viewer. In the end I had to make a couple concessions in order to keep the spirit of my 
        first design, while accounting for the aspects that I did not know how to make fit neatly. This 
        project was definitely an exercise in flexibility and foresight. I am not completely happy with 
        the look and feel of my website, but I do believe that the bones are strong. A good design sense 
        has never been my strong suit, so I am at least thankful for my improvements. If I had to grade 
        my own work, I would say that I believe I have more than met the hard technical requirements, 
        but the softer design reqs were a struggle and do not make for the best viewer experience. I am 
        incredibly biased, but I think I deserve an A for effort, a satisfactory in tech design, and a 
        meh in UI/UX.
